# DNSTrafficAnalyzer
A lightweight command-line tool for real-time DNS traffic monitoring and threat detection. It detects DNS tunneling, spoofing, and suspicious network activities using machine learning and rule-based analysis. Built for security analysts and learners, this tool enhances network security while providing hands-on experience in cybersecurity.

# Features
Captures and analyzes DNS traffic from a PCAP file.
Detects suspicious domain lookups by analyzing the queried domain names.
Identifies potential DNS tunneling by examining the DNS query types.
Alerts on communication with known malicious domains based on DNS responses.
Detects DNSSEC validation failures.
Identifies DNS amplification attacks.
Detects fast flux domains.
Identifies DNS rebinding.
Logs detected suspicious activities using a configurable logging system.

# Usage
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Prepare a PCAP file containing DNS traffic that you want to analyze.

Run the script by executing the following command:
        python dns_traffic_analysis.py <pcap_file>
        Replace <pcap_file> with the path to your PCAP file.

The script will process the DNS traffic in the PCAP file and perform analysis.

Suspicious domain lookups, potential DNS tunneling, or communication with malicious domains will be reported through the configured logging system.

Review the logs generated by the script to identify any identified suspicious activities.
# System Requirements 
     OS Compatibility: Windows, Linux (Kali), macOS 
     Python Version: 3.x 
     Dependencies: Install via: 
               pip install scapy pandas scikit-learn colorama

# How to Run It: 
1.Windows: Open Command Prompt as Administrator: 
       cd C:\SmartDNSTrafficAnalyzer 
       python smart_dns_analyzer.py 
  Or with custom thresholds: 
       python smart_dns_analyzer.py --entropy 3.5 --length 30 --ttl 10 --freq 5 
2.Kali Linux: Open Terminal with sudo: 
       cd /path/to/SmartDNSTrafficAnalyzer 
       sudo python3 smart_dns_analyzer.py 
  Or with custom thresholds: 
       sudo python3 smart_dns_analyzer.py --entropy 3.5 --length 30 --ttl 10 --freq 5 
3.macOS: Open Terminal (admin via sudo if needed): 
       cd /path/to/SmartDNSTrafficAnalyzer 
       python3 smart_dns_analyzer.py 
4.Create Allowlist/Blocklist (Optional) 
    In the same folder, create allowlist.txt (e.g., www.google.com) and blocklist.txt (e.g., 
       badsite.com). 
    Use Notepad (Windows) or nano (Linux/macOS) to edit these lists. 
    Outcome: The tool will allow/block specific domains based on user-defined lists.
