# DNSTrafficAnalyzer

A lightweight command-line tool for real-time DNS traffic monitoring and threat detection. It detects DNS tunneling, spoofing, and suspicious network activities using machine learning and rule-based analysis. Built for security analysts and learners, this tool enhances network security while providing hands-on experience in cybersecurity.

# Features:

   1.Live DNS traffic capture and analysis
   
   2.Detection of DNS tunneling and spoofing attacks
   
   3.Customizable detection thresholds
   
   4.Real-time alerts and logging

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, Scapy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

# Usage
ðŸ”¹Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

ðŸ”¹Prepare a PCAP file containing DNS traffic that you want to analyze.

ðŸ”¹Run the script by executing the following command:

        python dns_traffic_analysis.py <pcap_file>
        
        Replace <pcap_file> with the path to your PCAP file.

ðŸ”¹The script will process the DNS traffic in the PCAP file and perform analysis.

ðŸ”¹Suspicious domain lookups, potential DNS tunneling, or communication with malicious domains 
    will be reported through the configured logging system.

ðŸ”¹Review the logs generated by the script to identify any identified suspicious activities.

# System Requirements 
    1. OS Compatibility: Windows, Linux (Kali), macOS 
    2. Python Version: 3.x 
    3. Dependencies: Install via: 
               pip install scapy pandas scikit-learn colorama

# How to Run It: 
1.Windows: Open Command Prompt as Administrator: 

       cd C:\SmartDNSTrafficAnalyzer
       
       python smart_dns_analyzer.py 

  Or with custom thresholds: 
   
        python smart_dns_analyzer.py --entropy 3.5 --length 30 --ttl 10 --freq 5 

2.Kali Linux: Open Terminal with sudo: 
       
       cd /path/to/SmartDNSTrafficAnalyzer 

       sudo python3 smart_dns_analyzer.py 

 Or with custom thresholds: 
 
       sudo python3 smart_dns_analyzer.py --entropy 3.5 --length 30 --ttl 10 --freq 5 

3.macOS: Open Terminal (admin via sudo if needed): 
       
       cd /path/to/SmartDNSTrafficAnalyzer 
       
       python3 smart_dns_analyzer.py 

4.Create Allowlist/Blocklist (Optional) 
    
    In the same folder, create allowlist.txt (e.g., www.google.com) and blocklist.txt (e.g., 
       badsite.com). 
    
    Use Notepad (Windows) or nano (Linux/macOS) to edit these lists. 
    
    Outcome: The tool will allow/block specific domains based on user-defined lists.

# GUI Features
ðŸ”¹Start/Stop Monitoring â€“ Button to initiate or stop DNS traffic capture.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Threat Alerts â€“ Display flagged DNS queries with color-coded severity.

ðŸ”¹ Threshold Customization â€“ Users can adjust entropy, length, TTL, and frequency via input 
    fields.

ðŸ”¹ Log Viewer â€“ Display saved suspicious DNS queries.

ðŸ”¹ Allowlist/Blocklist Management â€“ Users can manually add trusted or blacklisted domains.
